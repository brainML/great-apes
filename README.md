This repository contains the code to reproduce results in the manuscript:

"Behavior measures are predicted by how information is encoded in an individualâ€™s brain"

by Jennifer Williams and Leila Wehbe at Carnegie Mellon University.


The code supports:
- Training ROI-level and voxel-wise encoding models, including Average Participant Encoding models (APEs)
- Relating individual differences in how information is encoded in a participant's brain to their behavior measures.
- The code is designed to work with the Human Connectome Project fMRI data, but could be adapted for other datasets.
